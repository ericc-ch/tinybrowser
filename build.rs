//! Link-time size knobs for the shipping binary.
//!
//! These lived in `.cargo/config.toml` as global `rustflags`. They are scoped
//! to the release binary instead: they only shrink the shipping artifact.
//! Every link uses the toolchain's default rust-lld (the rustc 1.98.1
//! `unknown relocation (1875)` DWARF bug that forced bfd onto dev/test links
//! is gone on the pinned nightly). Nothing unwinds in release (`panic =
//! "abort"` from the profile; QuickJS-ng uses setjmp/longjmp), so
//! `[profile.release] rustflags` disables unwind-table emission outright
//! (`force-unwind-tables=no`): the shipping binary carries no `.eh_frame`
//! bodies beyond the CRT startup objects' 48-byte CIE. No post-link step is
//! left; `cargo build --release` is the shipped artifact.
//!
//! Sizes and method: `docs/size.md`.
