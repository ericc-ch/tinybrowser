# Limitations

Honest current gaps. Upstream engine gaps live in docs/upstream.md;
out-of-scope API families live in docs/priorities.md.

## JS engine

QuickJS bytecode interpreter, no JIT. DOM glue and agent scripts are
fine; JS-heavy pages run slower than V8 browsers. No benchmark yet.

## Rendering

One-shot PNG only: CDP Page.captureScreenshot is PNG-only
(crates/cdp/src/dispatch.rs:882), no continuous paint loop, no GPU,
no vsync, no video. requestAnimationFrame is a 16ms timer with
documented deviations: shared timer table, Date.now() timestamps,
no per-frame timestamp sharing (timers.js:63).

## Intl

NumberFormat and DateTimeFormat only. No Collator, PluralRules,
RelativeTimeFormat, ListFormat, or Segmenter. Real CLDR data for 7
locales (en-US es-ES de-DE ja-JP fr-FR zh-CN ko-KR,
tools/intl/generate-data); every other locale silently falls back.

## Strings

Lone surrogates survive in JS but read back as U+FFFD from the DOM
(blitz stores UTF-8; see docs/upstream.md).

## Missing surfaces

No workers or service-workers, no canvas or WebGL, sync XHR is
rejected, customized built-in elements are rejected, CSSRuleList
throws. Shadow DOM and form-control state are upstream gaps
(docs/upstream.md).
