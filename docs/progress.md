## WPT

Since 2026-11-05 the push gate in `wpt.yml` runs in-process (`run in-process`,
plus WebDriver only for testdriver and worker/module wrappers, plus native
test262), and it is the only suite run: the nightly WebDriver duplicate was
removed on 2026-11-07. It fires on pushes to `main` that touch code, the
harness, the WPT pin, or the build environment; a docs-only push does not
spend the 20-job matrix. A 2,195-test same-build comparison of the two
executors agreed on 94.9% of verdicts and passed 1,148 vs 1,150.

The gate first passed in run 41972597140 at the 11/9 split: 15m03 wall for
the 119k-test suite, of which 1m34 was queue, 1m42 plan, 3m17 build (one job
per binary, three links in parallel), 9m47 test and 22s score. That run
measured the harness lane at ~74 chunk-minutes at 4 jobs and the WebDriver
lane at ~32, so the 20-job limit splits 14/6 rather than 11/9. Run 41974678252
(14/6, 4s queue) took 11m19: 1m47 plan, 3m57 build, 6m34 test, 24s score,
with harness chunks summing 70.6 chunk-minutes (218-393s) and WebDriver 27.8
(202-332s). The slowest harness chunk alone set the test phase. One harness
process carries 600 files (the engine keeps ~5 MB per file alive, see
`docs/upstream.md`) and journals every file, so an engine abort costs one
ERROR instead of a chunk, and a page that stops returning is cut by a
watchdog instead of the job timeout.

Run 42013267456 took 11m09: 1m50 plan, 4m29 build, 6m11 test, 22s score, with
harness chunks summing 79.1 chunk-minutes and WebDriver 29.5 (the build is
longer than 41974678252's 3m57 only because the blitz submodule changed and
more of it recompiled). 108.6 chunk-minutes over 20 four-core jobs puts the
test phase's floor at 5m26; the spread inside the harness lane (275-382s) is
hash-partition noise, so re-splitting the lanes cannot beat it. All eight
engine aborts the harness found are now fixed: the first six in the fork, and
the last two were dependency panics with a blitz-side cause (see
`docs/upstream.md`), so they moved five files from ERROR to PASS or OK without
changing any other verdict.

Run 42015620914 (11m27: 31s queue, 1m41 plan, 4m08 build, 6m48 test, 28s
score) is the first scored with the corrected `is_expected` in
`tools/wpt/cli.py` (`db0985ff`): 118,532 tests, 68,809 pass, 13,528 expfail,
28,190 unexpected, 4,130 timeout, 1 crash, 3,874 error. Before that fix the
same reports were mis-scored because a status was compared with itself.

Run 42027403312 (11m25: 3s queue, 1m49 plan, 4m16 build, 6m44 test, 20s score)
is the first with every known engine abort fixed:
`css/css-borders/border-radius-greater-than-width.html` and
`css/css-viewport/zoom/massive-zoom-viewbox-crash.html` move from ERROR to
PASS, and the run has 0 crashes: 118,532 tests, 68,810 pass, 13,527 expfail,
28,192 unexpected, 4,132 timeout, 0 crash, 3,871 error. The rest of the
verdict movement against the previous run is noise, not regressions:
timeouts flip both ways with runner load, and the `font-stretch`/`css-text`
reftests flip with font rasterisation (repeated local runs of one binary flip
the same files).

### referrer-policy/ (non-worker), 2026-10-25

Chrome 157 (WPT 9f868fd7) passes 892 of the 899 files that run here once
worker variants and their generated directories are set aside; tinybrowser
passes 890. The two-file gap is the style engine:

- 2 SVG (`css-integration/svg/{external-stylesheet,processing-instruction}`):
  paint servers (`fill: url()`, `stroke: url()`) are not fetched, and this
  Servo build does not generate `filter: url()`, `marker-*`, or a computed
  `clip-path: url()`, so 7 of the 9 paint properties in each file cannot reach
  a request. The other four `css-integration/svg/` files fail the same seven
  subtests and are Chrome failures too. This is the ceiling: 890 of the 899
  files is the most this engine can pass without a forked style engine.

The files that used to be blocked on popups and child history now pass:

- `generic/inheritance/popup-inheritance-about-blank.html`: `window.open()`
  now creates an auxiliary top-level context in the same renderer for a blank
  or same-origin URL, so the opener, `document`, `opener`, and messaging are
  live synchronously. Cross-origin popups keep the browser-tab proxy.
- `generic/inheritance/{iframe-inheritance-history-about-blank,
  iframe-inheritance-history-about-srcdoc}.html`: the engine keeps each child
  navigable's own session history, and a traversal installs the saved
  `about:blank`/`about:srcdoc` document state (origin, policy container,
  referrer) instead of re-fetching. The srcdoc file is now ahead of Chrome,
  which fails one of its subtests.

The remaining Chrome failures (`popup-inheritance-form-submission.html`,
`workers.html`, the four SVG files above) fail here too, so they cost nothing
against the Chrome score. `iframe-upgrade-request-to-cross-origin` passes here
and fails in Chrome.

The 30 generated `script-tag-dynamic-import` files used to time out at the
7.2 s budget, each with 12 subtests unreported. Nothing was slow: the renderer
drain reported idle while a module evaluation sat in a realm's outbox, so the
next test case only started when the harness timeout arrived. The session now
asks whether ready work remains after publishing, and the drain reconciles once
more before declaring itself idle. See the `renderer: stop parking the drain`
commit.

`css-integration/svg/` is the one harness-policy exception: each file sleeps
800 ms per subtest (7.2 s total) before checking, above the 3 s default, so
those files get a 6 s budget (8 s with grace, still under testharness.js's
10 s clock). See `tools/wpt/README.md`.
