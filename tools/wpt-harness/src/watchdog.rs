//! A per-worker deadline, so a file that never returns ends one process
//! instead of the chunk.
//!
//! The harness budget cannot interrupt code that never comes back to the
//! harness loop: a layout recursion, an endless promise chain, a drain that
//! never yields. Those cannot be unwound either, so the only recovery is the
//! process ending, after which the driver records that file as TIMEOUT and
//! resumes from the journal. This is what notices, and it has to notice before
//! the recursion overflows the stack and aborts with no verdict at all.
