//! One document's dial ledger: what is queued, what is in flight, and every
//! cancellation handle.
//!
//! The ledger is the document's fetch group. Every started dial of every kind
//! files its cancellation handle here, so aborting the document terminates
//! classic scripts, frame loads, stylesheets, images, and page `fetch` alike
//! (<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/document-lifecycle.html#abort-a-document>,
//! <https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-fetch-group>). A navigation replaces
//! the ledger, so the new document cannot adopt a completion from the old one.
//!
//! The ledger owns the completion channel and the `load`-event delay policy, so
//! no other module sees a sender, receiver, or guard.
